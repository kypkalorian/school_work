# class notes


what are the levels of a computer?

*I was downloading nano but we discussed assembly, the OS, Instruction Structure?, and some other things*


Noted the three main Process Management, Memory Management, Storage Management. Big 3. 

He won't have time to cover the security section since this is an introductory class - we should read on our own for the good of it. 

	Computer system is 4 parts:
		
		Hardware

		Operating System

		Application Programs

		Users



Operating system is all about resources: network, hdd, cpu, gpu, ram, I/O etc


Operating system is a CONTROL PROGRAM and a RESOURCE ALLOCATOR
	-prevents errors and improper use of computer


Operating system should OPTIMIZE not just operate
	-We must build lots of mathematical models to find the most optimal way to do it. Algorithms.

Kernel is loaded into the main memory from storage since it's too big


SIDE NOTES DURING THIS LECTURE: WHAT IS THE PROF TRYING TO COMMUNICATE:

	what is an operating systems job?: manage resources, control program. Optimize, algorithms. Kernel!

END SIDTE NOTE


Bootstrap program stored in eprom or something like that and is known as FIRMWARE
	-initializes all aspects of system
	-Loads Kernel

Interrupts work through an interrupt vector (vector having many values in it) -> Trap or Exception

our OS is interrupt driven.
