int EXEC //So i guess exec is an int?


===============

EXEC_L_:

const char *path
const char *arg
...
NULL

==============

exec_LP_:

const char file
const char *arg
...
NULL

=================

EXEC_LE_:

const char *path
const char *arg
...
NULL
char *const envp[]]


================

EXEC_V_:
char *PATH
char *argv[]

EXEC_VP_:
char *FILE
char *argv[]

EXEC_VPE_:
char *FILE
char * argv[]
char * envp[]




==================
Summary
==================

There are two exec types

EXECL AND EXECV

Each side has:

The basic EXECL/V which uses a path pointer

They both have an EXEC LP and VP which uses the file pointer

Both have lE and VPE which have a pointer to ENVP[] whatever that is

L/V * PATH
LP/VP * FILE
LE/VPE * PATH/FILE



L: they pass the arguments one at a time followed by NULL;

V: Pass arguments as a char * argv[];


the one's with E include ENVP[]

//More notes:

For assignment 2 I will most likely use a while loop to fill up a char * array to be passed to exec[arg]V INSTEAD of execL[ist]


Example code?

10 array and fill the rest up with NULLS? test this
